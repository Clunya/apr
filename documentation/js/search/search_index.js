дат Пасх и передача этих дат в формате миллисекунд в компонент седмиц - sed.component.ts\nСложность вычисления заключается в том, что само вычисление даты Пасхи всегда бывает в двух гражданских годах. До нового года и после него. Гражданский год увеличивается на единицу, а Богослужебный год остается тот же.\nМы получаем текущий год, на его основании вычисляем дату Пасхи. Далее отнимаем от даты вычисленной Пасхи текущую дату и проверяем знак результата.\nЕсли текущая дата менее даты Пасхи одноименного года то НГ уже был в Пасхальном году так как результат вычисления будет положительный. Если же результат вычисления отрицательный, значит Нового года в текущем Пасхальном году еще не было.\n\nКак видно на диаграмме, Богослужебный год начинается в одно время, но заканчивается всегда в другое, – или до даты начала Бывшей Пасхи или После нее. На диаграмме это представлено в виде трех Пасх. Розовый кружок - это внутрь-Пасха. Бежевый кружок это вне-Пасха. В зависимости такого движения возникают отступки и преступки в чтениях Священных Писаний. Такие отступки, преступки, промежуточные седмицы представлены в компоненте соответствующими перемеными.\n\n    \n\n    \n        import { Component, Injectable, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport

Так как чтения Евангелия после Пасхи расчитано на 50 седмиц, то подразумевается, что с 17-седмицы и далее должно быть начато Евангелие от Луки в первую неделю (воскресение) после праздника Воздвижения Креста. Таков расчет для Пасхального года.\nТакое может совпасть только если в Пасхальном году будет 50 седмиц. Переменная otstupkaV показывает превышение числа 17. Аргумент переменной otstupkaV и будет отступкой для повторных чтений до праздника Воздвижения.\nПеременная prestupkaV показывает нехватку до числа 17. В такие годы опускают недочитаное и чтут Евангелие от Луки.\n\n    \n\n    \n        import { Component, Input, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { DateService } from '../date.service';\n\n\n/**\n * Набор гласов для седмиц\n */\nconst GLASSEDMIC = {\n   \"1\": 8,  \"2\": 1,  \"3\": 2,  \"4\": 3,  \"5\": 4,  \"6\": 5,  \"7\": 6,  \"8\": 7,\n   \"9\": 8, \"10\": 1, \"11\": 2, \"12\": 3, \"13\": 4, \"14\": 5, \"15\": 6, \"16\": 7,\n  \"17\": 8, \"18\": 1, \"19\": 2, \"20\": 3, \"21\": 4, \"22\": 5, \"23\": 6, \"24\": 7,\n  \"25\": 8, \"26\": 1, \"27\": 2, \"28\": 3, \"29\": 4, \"30\": 5, \"31\": 6, \"32\": 7,\n  \"33\": 8, \"34\": 1, \"35\": 2, \"36\": 3, \"37\": 4, \"38\": 5, \"39\": 6, \"40\": 7,\n  \"41\": 8, \"42\": 1, \"43\": 2, \"44\": 3, \"45\": 4, \"46\": 5, \"47\": 6, \"48\": 7,\n  \"49\": 8, \"50\": 1, \"51\": 2, \"52\": 3, \"53\": 4, \"54\": 5, \"55\": 6, \"56\": 7,\n  \"57\": 8\n}\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-sed',\n  templateUrl: './sed.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./sed.component.css']\n})\n\n/*\n* ## КЛАСС ВЫЧИСЛЕНИЯ СЕДМИЦ ДЛЯ ВСЕГО ПАСХАЛЬНОГО ГОДА С УЧЕТОМ ОСТСТУПОК ПО СОВРЕМЕННОМУ ГРИГОРИАНСКОМУ КАЛЕНДАРЮ.\n*/\nexport class SedComponent implements OnInit {\n\n  @Input()  \n\n  datesEasterYear: any;\n  monthsArray: string[];\n\n  /** \n   * вычисление количества седмиц Богослужебного года \n  */\n  sumWeeks: number;\n\n  /**\n   * Текущая седмица по Пасхе\n   */\n  currentWeek: number;\n\n  /**\n   * Cедмица по Пятидесятнице\n   */\n  weekAfterPyatidesyatnica: number;\n  glas: string;\n\n  timeBoxVozdvijjenie: number;\n  sumWeeksAfterVozdvijjenie: number;\n  timeBox = new Date().getTime();\n  numberVozdvijjenie: number;\n\n  /**\n   * Дата текущей Пасхи для формирования даты Воздвижения из милисекунд\n   */\n  yearLastEaster: Date;\n\n  /**\n   * Дата грядущей Пасхи для формирования даты Недели Мытаря и Фарисея из милисекунд\n   */\n  yearNextEaster: Date;\n\n  /**\n   * Переменные для значений отступки и преступки в чтениях\n   * Указывают сдвиг от празднества Воздвижения в обе стороны\n   */\n  otstupkaV: number;\n  prestupkaV: number;\n\n  /**\n   * Переменная для даты Недели Мытаря и Фарисея\n   */\n  mif: Date;\n\n  /**\n   * Количество промежуточных седмиц пред Неделей Мытаря и Фарисея, если таковые случились\n   */\n  betweenWeeks: number;\n\n  /**\n   * Конвертированная дата\n   */\n  mifRussianDate?: string;\n\n  /**\n   * CSS седмицы \n   */\n  sedStyle: object = { \"color\": \"#e3423477\", \"font-weight\": \"bold\", \"font-size\": \"1.5em\" };\n\n  /**\n   * Високосный год\n   */\n  v_year: boolean;\n\n  /**\n   * Переменная для вывода русского слова в шаблоне html (преступка или отступка)\n   */\n  stupka: string;\n\n\n  public constructor(public _datesService: DateService) {\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Стартовая инициализация объектов значениями дат\n   */\n  ngOnInit() {\n    this.numberOfWeeks();\n    this.yearNextEaster = new Date(this.datesEasterYear.nextEaster);\n    this.v_year = this.vg();\n    this.otstupkaVozdvijjenie();\n    this.promWeeks();\n\n  }\n\n  /**\n    * Вычисление `разницы` между текущем временем и датой прошедшей Пасхи.\n    * Обрезка значения до целого.\n    * Вычисление текущей седмицы.\n    * Вычисление седмицы по Пятьдесятнице\n*/\n  numberOfWeeks() {\n    this.sumWeeks = (Math.trunc((this.datesEasterYear.nextEaster -
