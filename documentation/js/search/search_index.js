Креста\nПеременная otstupkaV получает число, которое равно количеству седмиц превыщающих число 17. Так как чтения Евангелия после Пасхи расчитано на 50 седмиц, то подразумевается, что с 17-седмицы и далее должно быть начато Евангелие от Луки в первую неделю (воскресение) после праздника Воздвижения Креста. Таков расчет для Пасхального года.\nТакое может совпасть только если в Пасхальном году будет 50 седмиц. Переменная otstupkaV показывает превышение числа 17. Аргумент переменной otstupkaV и будет отступкой для повторных чтений до праздника Воздвижения.\nПеременная prestupkaV показывает нехватку до числа 17. В такие годы опускают недочитаное и чтут Евангелие от Луки.\n\n    \n\n    \n        import { Component, Input, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { XxxService } from '../xxx.service';\n\n/*\n* компонент вычисления седмиц всего Пасхального года\n*/\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-sed',\n  templateUrl: './sed.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./sed.component.css']\n})\nexport class SedComponent implements OnInit {\n\n  @Input() datesEasterYear: any;\n\n  /** \n   * вычисление количества седмиц Богослужебного года \n  */\n  sumWeaks: number;\n\n/**\n * Текущая седмица по Пасхе\n */\n  currentWeak: number;\n\n  /**\n   * Cедмица по Пятидесятнице\n   */\n  weakAfterPyatidesyatnica: number;\n  glas: string;\n\n  timeBoxVozdvijjenie: number;\n  sumWeaksAfterVozdvijjenie: number;\n  timeBox: number = new Date().getTime();\n  numberVozdvijjenie: number;\n\n  /**\n   * Конвертирует дату текущей Пасхи для формирования даты Воздвижения из милисекунд\n   */\n  yearLastEaster: Date;\n  otstupkaV: number;\n  prestupkaV: number;\n\n\n\n  constructor(public _xxxService: XxxService) {\n  }\n  ngOnInit() {\n\n    this.numberOfWeaks();\n    console.log(this.otstupkaVozdvijjenie());\n    this.seedPyatidesyatnica();\n    // this.glasSed(String(this.allWeaks))\n    console.log(this.glas);\n    \n\n  }\n\n  /** \n    * Вычисление `разницы` между текущем временем и датой прошедшей Пасхи.
