Креста\nПеременная otstupkaV получает число, которое равно количеству седмиц превыщающих число 17. Так как чтения Евангелия после Пасхи расчитано на 50 седмиц, то подразумевается, что с 17-седмицы и далее должно быть начато Евангелие от Луки в первую неделю (воскресение) после праздника Воздвижения Креста. Таков расчет для Пасхального года.\nТакое может совпасть только если в Пасхальном году будет 50 седмиц. Переменная otstupkaV показывает превышение числа 17. Аргумент переменной otstupkaV и будет отступкой для повторных чтений до праздника Воздвижения.\nПеременная prestupkaV показывает нехватку до числа 17. В такие годы опускают недочитаное и чтут Евангелие от Луки.\n\n    \n\n    \n        import { Component, Input, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { DateService } from '../date.service';\n\n\n/**\n * Набор гласов для седмиц\n */\nconst glasSedmic = {\n\n   \"1\": 8,  \"2\": 1,  \"3\": 2,  \"4\": 3,  \"5\": 4,  \"6\": 5,  \"7\": 6,  \"8\": 7,\n   \"9\": 8, \"10\": 1, \"11\": 2, \"12\": 3, \"13\": 4, \"14\": 5, \"15\": 6, \"16\": 7,\n  \"17\": 8, \"18\": 1, \"19\": 2, \"20\": 3, \"21\": 4, \"22\": 5, \"23\": 6, \"24\": 7,\n  \"25\": 8, \"26\": 1, \"27\": 2, \"28\": 3, \"29\": 4, \"30\": 5, \"31\": 6, \"32\": 7,\n  \"33\": 8, \"34\": 1, \"35\": 2, \"36\": 3, \"37\": 4, \"38\": 5, \"39\": 6, \"40\": 7,\n  \"41\": 8, \"42\": 1, \"43\": 2, \"44\": 3, \"45\": 4, \"46\": 5, \"47\": 6, \"48\": 7,\n  \"49\": 8, \"50\": 1, \"51\": 2, \"52\": 3, \"53\": 4, \"54\": 5, \"55\": 6, \"56\": 7,\n  \"57\": 8, \"58\": 1, \"59\": 2, \"60\": 3, \"61\": 4, \"62\": 5, \"63\": 6, \"64\": 7,\n  \"65\": 8,\n\n}\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-sed',\n  templateUrl: './sed.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./sed.component.css']\n})\n\n/*\n* ## КЛАСС ВЫЧИСЛЕНИЯ СЕДМИЦ ДЛЯ ВСЕГО ПАСХАЛЬНОГО ГОДА С УЧЕТОМ ОСТСТУПОК ПО СОВРЕМЕННОМУ ГРИГОРИАНСКОМУ КАЛЕНДАРЮ.\n*/\nexport class SedComponent implements OnInit {\n\n  @Input()  \n  datesEasterYear: any;\n  monthsArray: string[];\n\n  /** \n   * вычисление количества седмиц Богослужебного года \n  */\n  sumWeeks: number;\n\n  /**\n   * Текущая седмица по Пасхе\n   */\n  currentWeek: number;\n\n  /**\n   * Cедмица по Пятидесятнице\n   */\n  weekAfterPyatidesyatnica: number;\n  glas: string;\n\n  timeBoxVozdvijjenie: number;\n  sumWeeksAfterVozdvijjenie: number;\n  timeBox = new Date().getTime();\n  numberVozdvijjenie: number;\n\n  /**\n   * Дата текущей Пасхи для формирования даты Воздвижения из милисекунд\n   */\n  yearLastEaster: Date;\n\n  /**\n   * Дата грядущей Пасхи для формирования даты Недели Мытаря и Фарисея из милисекунд\n   */\n  yearNextEaster: Date;\n\n\n  otstupkaV: number;\n  prestupkaV: number;\n\n  mif: Date;\n\n  /**\n   * Количество промежуточных седмиц пред Неделей Мытаря и Фарисея, если таковые случились\n   */\n  betweenWeeks: number;\n\n  /**\n   * Конвертированная дата\n   */\n  mifRussianDate?: string;\n\n  /**\n   * CSS седмицы \n   */\n  sedStyle: object = { \"color\": \"#e3423477\", \"font-weight\": \"bold\" };\n\n\n  public constructor(public _datesService: DateService) {\n\n  }\n  ngOnInit() {\n    this.numberOfWeeks();\n    this.yearNextEaster = new Date(this.datesEasterYear.nextEaster);\n    this.otstupkaVozdvijjenie();\n    this.seedPyatidesyatnica();\n    this.promWeeks();\n\n  }\n\n  /**\n    * Вычисление `разницы` между текущем временем и датой прошедшей Пасхи.\n    * Обрезка значения до целого.\n    * Вычисление текущей седмицы.\n    * Вычисление седмицы по Пятьдесятнице\n*/\n  numberOfWeeks() {\n    this.sumWeeks = (Math.trunc((this.datesEasterYear.nextEaster - this.datesEasterYear.lastEaster) / 864E5 / 7));\n    this.currentWeek = (Math.trunc((Date.now() - this.datesEasterYear.lastEaster) / 864E5 / 7 + 1));\n    if (this.sumWeeks===8) {\n      this.weekAfterPyatidesyatnica = this.sumWeeks - 7;\n      \n    } else {\n      this.weekAfterPyatidesyatnica = null;\n    }\n\n    // вычисление даты и количества промежуточных седмиц\n    if (this.vg())\n    {\n      this.mif = new Date(this.datesEasterYear.nextEaster - 6047999999 + 86400000);\n\n      this.mifRussianDate = String(this.mif.getDay() + this._datesService.monthsArray[this.mif.getMonth()]);\n\n      console.log(\"Это дата для високосного года\", this.mif);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      this.mif = new Date(this.datesEasterYear.nextEaster - 6047999999);\n      this.mifRussianDate = this.mif.getDate() + \" \" + this._datesService.monthsArray[this.mif.getMonth()];\n    }\n\n    console.log(\"Текущая седмица\", this.currentWeek);\n    console.log(\"Дата Мытаря и Фарисея\", this.mif.toDateString());\n    console.log(\"Кол-во седмиц в Пасхальном году (между Пасхами): \", this.sumWeeks);\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Возвращает кол-во седмиц отступпки или преступки для праздника Воздвижения Креста.\n   */\n  private otstupkaVozdvijjenie() {\n    this.yearLastEaster = new Date(this.datesEasterYear.lastEaster);\n    this.numberVozdvijjenie = this.yearLastEaster.getFullYear();\n    this.timeBoxVozdvijjenie = new Date(this.numberVozdvijjenie, 8, 27).getTime();\n    this.sumWeeksAfterVozdvijjenie = (Math.trunc((this.timeBoxVozdvijjenie - this.datesEasterYear.lastEaster) / 864E5 / 7) - 6);\n    console.log(\"Количество седмиц от Пасхи до Воздвижения Креста: \", this.sumWeeksAfterVozdvijjenie);\n\n    this.otstupkaV = this.sumWeeksAfterVozdvijjenie - 17;\n    this.prestupkaV = this.sumWeeks;\n\n    /**\n     * В данном операторе `if` проверяется было ли Воздвижение и превышает ли кол-во седмиц число 17.
