- sed.component.ts\nСложность вычисления заключается в том, что само вычисление даты Пасхи всегда бывает в двух гражданских годах. До нового года и после него. Гражданский год увеличивается на единицу, а Богослужебный год остается тот же.\nМы получаем текущий год, на его основании вычисляем дату Пасхи. Далее отнимаем от даты вычисленной Пасхи текущую дату и проверяем знак результата.\nЕсли текущая дата менее даты Пасхи одноименного года то НГ уже был в Пасхальном году так как результат вычисления будет положительный. Если же результат вычисления отрицательный, значит Нового года в текущем Пасхальном году еще не было.\n\nКак видно на диаграмме, Богослужебный год начинается в одно время, но заканчивается всегда в другое, – или до даты начала Бывшей Пасхи или После нее. На диаграмме это представлено в виде трех Пасх. Розовый кружок - это внутрь-Пасха. Бежевый кружок это вне-Пасха. В зависимости такого движения возникают отступки и преступки в чтениях Священных Писаний. Такие отступки, преступки, промежуточные седмицы представлены в компоненте соответствующими перемеными.\n\n    \n\n    \n        import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport { Injectable, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Easter } from '../intrfc/interfaces';\n\n/**\n  * Православная Пасхалия.\n  */\n const PASKHALIA = {\n\n   2015: [3, 12], 2016: [4, 1], 2017: [3, 16], 2018: [3, 8],  2019: [3, 28], 2020: [3, 19], 2021: [4, 2], 2022: [3, 24], 2023: [3, 16], 2024: [4, 5], 2025: [3, 20], 2026: [3, 12], 2027: [4, 2], 2028: [3, 16], 2029: [3, 8], 2030: [3, 28], 2031: [3, 13], 2032: [4, 2], 2033: [3, 24], 2034: [3, 9], 2035: [3, 29], 2036: [3, 20], 2037: [3, 5], 2038: [3, 25]\n\n };\n\n@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root'\n})\n\n\n\nexport class DateService implements OnInit, Easter {\n\n  keyYear: number;

получает число, которое равно количеству седмиц превыщающих число 17. Так как чтения Евангелия после Пасхи расчитано на 50 седмиц, то подразумевается, что с 17-седмицы и далее должно быть начато Евангелие от Луки в первую неделю (воскресение) после праздника Воздвижения Креста. Таков расчет для Пасхального года.\nТакое может совпасть только если в Пасхальном году будет 50 седмиц. Переменная otstupkaV показывает превышение числа 17. Аргумент переменной otstupkaV и будет отступкой для повторных чтений до праздника Воздвижения.\nПеременная prestupkaV показывает нехватку до числа 17. В такие годы опускают недочитаное и чтут Евангелие от Луки.\n\nTODO:\nРешить задачу по диапазону високосного года в феврале\ndescription: с 16 по 29 февраля високосного года случается смещение дат на единицу.
